2.Introduction.
This project is used to predict price of some stock

3.Explain technology.
Because stock is time-series data and I want to predict openning price, closing price, high price,low prict in the next section .So I use model LSTM and in the last layer
I use 4 unit represent openning price, closing price, hight price,low price and activation funtion in this layer is x = f(x)
